## Overview
This project provides a C implementation for trimming a Binary Search Tree (BST) such that all its 
elements lie within a specified range [low, high]. Trimming the tree ensures that the relative 
structure of the remaining elements is preserved. The root of the trimmed BST is returned, 
which may differ from the original root depending on the given bounds.

## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, trim the tree so that all nodes' values lie within the range [low, high]. The trimming process should not alter the relative structure of the remaining elements. It is guaranteed that there is a unique solution.
